Thank you for reporting an issue!
Please make sure to give answers for the following:

1) Which Modpack version are you using?
 
2) Link to the crashlog (found in the crash-reports folder).
 Don't post whole crashlogs directly in here!
 I recommend to use pastebin for the crashlogs: https://pastebin.com/
 
3) Detailed description of the issue and if possible pls attach images
 
4) Is the issue repeatable?
 
5) Do you know a possible fix for the issue?
