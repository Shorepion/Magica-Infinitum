**Mod suggestions**
*Feel free to propose mods to add to this pack¹.*

**Recipe changes/adaptations**
Any Recipe you want to be tweaked cause its too cheap/expensive?
Explain why you want to change this recipe.







*¹Make sure the suggested Mod:
- does not have similar functions to already included ones
- are not made witch MCModCreator (sorry, but I had bad experiences in the past)
- are not Tech/RF related Mods (->contradicts with modpacks concept)
Those mods will be denied right away.
For all other mods I can’t promise to add them, but I will surely take a look ;).
(If you can give some good descriptions and reasons why this mod fit or should be in the pack, the chance is even higher, that'll be added).*
