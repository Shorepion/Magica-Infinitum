**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional content**
Feel free to propose mods to add to this pack.

Make sure the suggested Mod:
- does not have similar functions to already included ones
- are not made witch MCModCreator (sorry, but I had bad experiences in the past)
- are not Tech/RF related Mods (->contradicts with modpacks concept)
Those mods will be denied right away.

For all other mods I canâ€™t promise to add them, but I will surely take a look ;).
(If you can give some good descriptions and reasons why this mod fit or should be in the pack, the chance is even higher, that'll be added).
